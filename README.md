## Process

### 1. Research on the contextual multi-armed bandit

- Contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) : Unlike traditional multi-armed bandit algorithm, each choice (arm) has a corresponding context ($x_{t,i}$). For example, a news article's classification, title, date, etc.
- LinUCB : An algorithm that assumes a linear model of each arm's reward expectation with a given context vector and makes decisions based on an upper confidence bound (UCB) on each arm's reward expectation.
- Thompson Sampling (LinTS) : An algorithm that assumes that each arm's reward expectation is a linear model with a given context vector, such as LinUCB, but makes decisions using the reward expectation of each arm obtained by sampling parameters from a posterior distribution estimated at each point in time by assuming that the parameters are random variables.

### 2. Chosing Data

- ** R6B - Yahoo! Front Page Today Module User Click Log Dataset, version 2.0 (300 MB)[[url]](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=r&did=54&guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIeRtdeIJKedFa2IxC_XpB7RtDW9NiBKEGrACYYXfa47q-Hfi0rg1anD96sXDrK-RwnSsfDEOi_GcBGd_n1bt1KsI3D739hrCcQRkHabNqQcpAzqE6tci2Z3XHlBdskYwTHMF9kzpEr8uOzQVR2F55v8UGC8qWSoya672QQPjFhP)
- Data is collected on whether a user with a random feature (displayed_arm) clicks on a news article (reward=1) or not (reward=0) with equal probability on a randomly displayed news article (displayed_arm) from a given set of news articles (pool) at a given point in time on the Yahoo front page.
